# The Project

For Epita (PROMO 2025) we have to build a shell in c language.

A shell is one of the most crucial programs in any operating system. 
This is why this project will focus on the creation of a unix shell. The concept may seem simple and easy enough to do but it is way more complicated than it looks mainly because it is going to be made from scratch and because of the long list of commands that exist. 
Choosing such a project is the most suitable choice because it would help our team tremendously for the 42sh next year.

+ |1| - First defence: cd/ls/echo/cat/clear and non-integrated ui (terminal)

# Console
Make sure the client and server are running.

# Tools

The shell is made using c. With gcc compilor. Gtk-3 and Gtksourceview-4 libraries. 

# Members of the team

+ Barbora Plašovská:

She will be in charge of the implementation of the commands, which also implies the implementation of pipes and options.
Her part mainly consists in the implementation and therefore execution of the commands.

+ Enrique Tarabay:

He is in charge with Charbel of the parsing part of the project, Charbel specifically at the beginning will be working on the lexical analysis of the string for the parsing.
After that, they will work together with Enrique in order to perfect the parsing process.

+ Charbel Abboud:

He is in charge with Enrique of the parsing part of the project, Charbel specifically at the beginning will be working on the syntactic analysis of the string for the parsing.
After that, they will work together with Enrique in order to perfect the parsing process.

+ Loic Mahatsangy Jy:

He is in charge of the GUI part and the project website which will track the whole project’s progress.
The GUI part consists of our own terminal window done using the GTK library while having the same functionalities as an ordinary terminal window.
